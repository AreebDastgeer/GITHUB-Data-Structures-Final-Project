# GitHub Simulation Console Application

This C++ project simulates basic functionalities of GitHub, such as user account management, repository management, commits, and social interactions, all within a command-line interface. It employs various data structures like AVL trees and hash tables for efficient user and repository management.

## Key Features

1. **User Accounts:**
   - Registration: Users can create new accounts with unique usernames and passwords.
   - Login/Logout: Users can securely login and logout from their accounts.
   - Profile View: Users can view their own or other users' profiles, including followers, repositories, and public repository files.

   - View Stats: Users can view repository statistics such as name, files, commits, and forks.

3. **Social Features:**
   - Follow/Unfollow: Users can follow or unfollow other users.

## Data Structures Used

- AVL trees for efficient user management.
- Hash tables for quick access to user information.
- Chaining for collision resolution in hash tables.

## Instructions for Use
